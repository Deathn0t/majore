      "DOx-0ZSIZkA hi everybody i 'm john graden from the martial arts teacher 's association and johngraden.com . one of the questions i have been asked through the years how do you choose a martial art ? it really varies it depends on what your goal is . are you trying to get in better shape , do you want to learn self defense , do you want to compete or are you just interested in the mental benefits of the martial arts offer you , mental benefits such as self confidence , self discipline , self control , respect , so there is a lot of variables . in my mind when people say what style is best , what style should i do the only style that is really important is the teaching style of the instructor . so how do you choose a good martial arts ? it is really more about choosing a good martial arts instructor , it 's about choosing a good martial arts school , so when you are going to make the decision make sure first you know what your goal is . if you really want a strong self defense oriented system you want to be working with an instructor who may have a police background a law enforcement background , some practical application in street self defense . if you are just looking to become a martial artist or a good black belt here is the key . you want to go and visit and watch the students , watch the beginner students and study in particular the teaching style of the instructor . how does that instructor interact with the students , how does that instructor conduct a class ? then go look at the advanced students . we want to make sure that they 're impressive , we want to make sure that they 're in shape , we want to make sure there is lots of them . what does that mean if there is lots of advanced students ? that means the school has a high retention . that means that it is a good school or she is a good instructor and she is able to keep her students for a long time . when you have a school that has lots of brown and black belts and they are impressive then you know you have an instructor that has a curriculum designed to keep students in the school so the teaching style is the most important style of any martial art . there are a variety of different styles , tai kwon do , kempo , kung fu , karate , i 'm not that interested in the style , i 'm interested in the teacher , making sure that teacher can help me or you to reach your goals . i 'm john graden for the martial arts teacher 's association . thanks . tune in for more martial arts excitement . thanks .\n",
